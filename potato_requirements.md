# Potato.py Requirements Document

## Project Overview
A Python program named potato.py that generates animated ASCII art of potatoes growing through various stages (seed, sprout, small plant, mature plant with potatoes). The program should be configurable, well-tested, and production-ready with proper packaging.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
- Generate ASCII art representations of potato growth stages
- Animate the growth process with configurable timing
- Support multiple potato varieties with different visual characteristics
- Allow customization of growth parameters (speed, stages, size)
- Provide both CLI interface and programmatic API
- Save animations to text files or display in terminal

### Growth Stages
1. **Seed Stage**: Simple dot or small symbol underground
2. **Germination**: Small root system appearing
3. **Sprouting**: Green shoot emerging from soil
4. **Vegetative Growth**: Stem and leaves developing
5. **Flowering**: Optional flower stage
6. **Tuber Formation**: Underground potatoes appearing
7. **Maturity**: Full-grown plant with visible potato harvest

### Configuration Options
- Growth speed (delay between stages)
- Canvas size (width/height of ASCII area)
- Potato variety (different ASCII patterns)
- Color support (if terminal supports it)
- Output format (terminal display, file export, or both)

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Modular design with separate concerns (rendering, animation, models)
- Plugin system for different potato varieties
- Configuration management via YAML/JSON files
- Logging system for debugging and monitoring

### Performance
- Efficient rendering for real-time animation
- Memory management for long-running animations
- Configurable frame rates

### Compatibility
- Python 3.8+ support
- Linux terminal
